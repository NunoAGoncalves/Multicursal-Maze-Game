## Overview

The following project is a C# program designed to generate random multicursal mazes. A multicursal maze is a type of maze that includes multiple paths and intersections, providing a more complex and challenging environment for exploration. The program utilizes the breadth-first search algorithm to enable the CPU to navigate through the maze.

Users can also interact with the maze by using arrow keys to control their character's movement. This feature allows for manual exploration and adds an interactive element to the maze-solving experience. The program provides real-time visualization of the maze, the position of the player character, and the position of the CPU opponent.
