# Multicursal Maze with Breadth-First CPU

A program in C# that generates mutlicursal mazes and a CPU that traverses the maze via the breadth-first search algorithm.

The program was created for UK OCR secondary-school computer science coursework. The documentation in the repository is a prototype of the document I sent for marking however. The program may also barely work, given the level of knowledge I had when I programmed it.

I do recall succesfully creating the maze, and creating a CPU that solves the maze nine out of ten times. The primary issue that I had with the CPU was that it could not succesfully backtrack whenever it had multiple pathways that led to a deadend.

Feel free to message me on LinkedIn if you want any advice or guidance regarding the OCR Computer Science A-Level coursework. I got 63/70 if I recall correctly.
