# Multicursal Maze with BFS CPU

A program in C# that generates mutlicursal mazes and a CPU that traverses the maze.

The program was created for UK OCR secondary-school computer science coursework. The documentation in the repository is a prototype of the document I sent for marking however.

Feel free to message me on LinkedIn if you want any advice or guidance regarding the OCR Computer Science A-Level coursework. I got an 63/70 if I recall correctly.
