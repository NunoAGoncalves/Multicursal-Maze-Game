# Multicursal Maze with Breadth-First CPU

A program in C# that generates mutlicursal mazes and a CPU that traverses the maze via the breadth-first search algorithm.

The program was created for UK OCR secondary-school computer science coursework. The documentation in the repository is a prototype of the document I sent for marking however.
